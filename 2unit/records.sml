(* record values - have fields holding values *)
(* record types have fields holding types *)
(* accessing: #myfieldname x where x is the variable that has a type
              defined earlier by a record *)

(* lot like tuples - 2 ways to do tuples now (4,7,9) and/or 
{f=4,g=7,h=9} - records easier to remember which is which and
order doesnt matter, but tuples are shorter to type
usually records better with more fields, easier to remember name-value pair
